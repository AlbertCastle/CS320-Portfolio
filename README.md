How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Well the most important thing to consider when keeping your software secure is error free code, 
having errors in your code means having vulnerabilites that can leave your software open to hackers. Another way to make sure your
code is secure is by using automated tools. By using testing techiques like static and dynmaic, you can scan your code and test it
at runtime for any security issues you might have. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
One of the ways we have done this throughout the CS program is by using use cases, these are similar to user stories that will
document the needs of the user. In this project we were given certain perameters such as charachter lengths. Having a clear outline
of what your client is looking for will help when coding a project. you dont want to waste time working on things that are not required,
this will lead to longer sprint times, which will have a chain reaction on the whole project. 

How do I approach designing software?
Well first we need to always figure out the customer requirments like I had mentioned above. But there are other ways that we can look at
such as creating documentation first. Creating a flow chart of the desired program will help with getting the bigger picture on how things work
If we have a large project with dozens of classes it will be hard to go through and look at the code itself for the ways the glues together. 
Making sure everything is documented correctly first will be a good approach, then you can worry about code and have the chart be a guide as you write
these charts are always good for anyone not directly invovled in the coding process, it gives them a solid overview of the project without all the technical gargin.
